## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow  

We use a **lightweight Gitflow-inspired workflow** to ensure **collaboration, accountability, and professional readiness**.  

1. **Issue Tracking**  
   - Every task/feature/bug must have a GitHub Issue.  
   - Assign issues to yourself before starting work.  

2. **Branching & Development**  
   - Branch from `develop`.  
   - Work on small, focused branches (1 issue = 1 branch).  

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
   - Open PRs into `develop` once work is ready.  
   - At least **1 peer review** is required before merging.  
   - CI checks (formatting, linting, tests if available) must pass.  

4. **Testing & Integration**  
   - Test features locally before creating a PR.  
   - After merging into `develop`, all members should pull and test integration.  
   - Merge `develop` â†’ `main` only when stable and tested.

## ðŸŒ± Branching Strategy  

### Main Branches
- **main** â†’ production-ready, stable code (**protected**)  
- **develop** â†’ staging / active development branch  

### Supporting Branches
- `feature/<lastname>-<short-description>` â†’ new features  
- `fix/<lastname>-<short-description>` â†’ bug fixes  
- `chore/<lastname>-<short-description>` â†’ configs, setup, or maintenance  

---

### Branch Naming  

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<lastname>-<short-description>
````

**Examples:**

* `feature/raboy-landing-page`
* `fix/mactual-navbar-bug`

**Rules:**

* Always use **lowercase**.
* Keep names short and descriptive.
* Use **hyphens (-)** instead of spaces.

---

### Commit Guidelines

Format:

```bash
<prefix>(<scope>): <message> - <name>
```

**Examples:**

* `feat(auth): implement login with Supabase - Raboy`
* `fix(ui): resolve trip logging bug - Lim`
* `docs(readme): update setup instructions - Mactual`

**Rules:**

* Prefix must follow the commit prefix table.
* Use **lowercase** (except for names).
* Keep messages clear and concise.
* Scope is optional but recommended.

#### ðŸ“Œ Commit Prefixes

| Prefix        | Meaning                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **feat:**     | A new feature                                    |
| **fix:**      | A bug fix                                        |
| **docs:**     | Documentation only changes                       |
| **style:**    | Code style changes (formatting, no logic change) |
| **refactor:** | Refactoring code (not a fix or feature)          |
| **test:**     | Adding or fixing tests                           |
| **chore:**    | Maintenance tasks (build, deps, configs, etc.)   |
